# PRODIGY_CS_01

This project implements a basic Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption tool using Python. The program accepts a message and a numeric shift value to produce an encrypted message and then decrypts it back to the original form.

## Features
- Encrypts alphabetic text using Caesar Cipher logic
- Decrypts the message to verify correctness
- Preserves spaces and non-alphabetic characters

## Usage
- Run the script
- Enter the message you want to encrypt
- Enter the number of letters to shift
- View both encrypted and decrypted results
